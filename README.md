# What is Spense?

Spense allows for a quick and convenient way to split the bill. Instead of attempting to keep tabs and trying to remember who owes what, Spense will allow you to manage transactions, by joining an existing group or creating a new one. Any user who is in the group will be able to see the calculated expenses, depending on whether the payment is to be split amongst all the users or only a select few.
